# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on signup form.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've worked with React, and I've forgotten some things. However, I've learned about nested statements in CSS, and it's amazing because it supports nesting by default without any additional library.

### Day 1: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on mynote component.

**Thoughts:** I've completed the styling and structural aspects of both the signup and signin components. While I faced challenges with the CSS grid, I successfully resolved the issue related to email autocomplete.

    }

### Day 2: January 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finalized working on mynotes component (CSS and HTML).

**Thoughts:** I'm not very experienced with CSS Grid, but I did manage to figure out and address the grid-related issues on my "mynotes" component. I've learned quite a bit, though I still need to stay vigilant and keep an eye on CSS Grid.

### Day 3: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on addnote component.

**Thoughts:** I'm just about done with the addnote component, but I'm having some trouble with the bordersâ€”they seem to be a jumping around when focus.

### Day 4: January 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the newnote component.

**Thoughts:** I've completed styling for the newnote component and resolved the border issue (they were jumping around when I added a border on focus). The solution was to include a transparent border on each input, so when it's in focus, it just changes colors.

    input{
	    border:  1px solid transparent;
    }
