# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on signup form.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've worked with React, and I've forgotten some things. However, I've learned about nested statements in CSS, and it's amazing because it supports nesting by default without any additional library.

### Day 1: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on mynote component.

**Thoughts:** I've completed the styling and structural aspects of both the signup and signin components. While I faced challenges with the CSS grid, I successfully resolved the issue related to email autocomplete.

    }

### Day 2: January 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finalized working on mynotes component (CSS and HTML).

**Thoughts:** I'm not very experienced with CSS Grid, but I did manage to figure out and address the grid-related issues on my "mynotes" component. I've learned quite a bit, though I still need to stay vigilant and keep an eye on CSS Grid.

### Day 3: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on addnote component.

**Thoughts:** I'm just about done with the addnote component, but I'm having some trouble with the borders—they seem to be a jumping around when focus.

### Day 4: January 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the newnote component.

**Thoughts:** I've completed styling for the newnote component and resolved the border issue (they were jumping around when I added a border on focus). The solution was to include a transparent border on each input, so when it's in focus, it just changes colors.

    input{
	    border:  1px solid transparent;
    }

### Day 5: January 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Added some logic to mynotes component.

**Thoughts:** I've made some updates to the interaction in my notes component, but I feel that the code is becoming a bit hard to read. I'm looking for a way to refactor the component for better clarity, even though the progress may not be significant.

### Day 6: January 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Strated working on little side project

**Thoughts:** As the MyNotes app starts to become a bit intricate, I realized I need to dive into understanding user authentication, and that's taking a bit of time. To keep things fresh, I've started working on a side project – a password generator app for a Frontend Mentor challenge.

### Day 7: January 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: The app is actually creating passwords

**Thoughts:** I tried out ChatGPT to write some code, and it was really useful. I had this one long string that I needed to split into four arrays, and it's awesome how quickly it tackled the task.

### Day 8: January 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Create a password strength check function

**Thoughts:** I found some issues with my current password generation function; sometimes, it fails to generate all possible combinations. I am still unable to find a solution to this problem.
