# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on signup form.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've worked with React, and I've forgotten some things. However, I've learned about nested statements in CSS, and it's amazing because it supports nesting by default without any additional library.

### Day 1: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started working on mynote component.

**Thoughts:** I've completed the styling and structural aspects of both the signup and signin components. While I faced challenges with the CSS grid, I successfully resolved the issue related to email autocomplete.

### Day 2: January 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finalized working on mynotes component (CSS and HTML).

**Thoughts:** I'm not very experienced with CSS Grid, but I did manage to figure out and address the grid-related issues on my "mynotes" component. I've learned quite a bit, though I still need to stay vigilant and keep an eye on CSS Grid.
